The Weather Data Analyzer is a simple Java program that allows users to input daily temperature readings for one week. The program then calculates and displays the average, minimum, and maximum temperatures.

This project is a practice in working with arrays, loops, and static utility methods in Java.


Features >>>

Input 7 daily temperature readings.

Store temperatures in an array.

Calculate and display:

Average temperature of the week

Minimum temperature

Maximum temperature


Concepts Used >>>

Arrays - store weekly temperature data.

Loops - iterate through the array for calculations.

Static methods - utility functions for average, min, and max.

User Input (Scanner) - read temperatures from the user.
